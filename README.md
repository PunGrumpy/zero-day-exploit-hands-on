        <b>Zero Day Exploit</b> is a vulnerability that is unknown to the developers and the public. It is exploited by hackers before the developers become aware of it and fix it.

## The Zero-day Predicament

The term "zero-day" originally referred to the number of days since a new piece of software was released to the public. Zero-day software could be obtained by developers who would pay a premium price to get the software first. The term was later applied to the vulnerability itself, and to the kind of exploit that was used to attack it.

### What Are Zero-day Attacks and How Do Zero-day Attacks Work?

A zero-day attack is a cyberattack that occurs on the same day a weakness is discovered in software. At that point, it's exploited before a fix becomes available from its creator. This type of attack exploits the lack of time (the "zero-day" part) available to prevent the attack or mitigate its effects.

### Who Carries Out Zero-day Attacks?

- **Cybercriminals** - Hackers whose motivation is usually financial gain.
- **Hacktivists** - Hackers motivated by political or social causes who want the attacks to be visible to draw attension to their cause.
- **Corporate Espionage** - Hackers who spy on companies to gain information about them
- **Cyberwarfare** - Countries or political actors spying on or attacking another country's cyberinfrastructure.

### Who Are the Targets of Zero-day Exploits?

- Operating systems
- Web browsers
- Office applications
- Open-source components
- Hardware and Firmware
- Internet of Things (IoT)

## How to Identify Zero-day Attacks

### How to Protect Yourself Against Zero-day Attacks

- Keep all and operating systems up to date
- Use only essential applications
- Use a firewall
- Within organizations, educate users
- Use a comprehensive antivirus software solution
- A solution based on behavior analysis could be another way of protection
- Monitoring unusual program behavior keeps information systems and software secure
